                        Blank Theme Reloaded
                        --------------------
               (aka Blank Theme 2: Electric Boogaloo)

This is Chris Coyiers "Blank" theme ported to WordPress 3.9.1 and updated
for 2014, as used at Speed. From the original description:

 It is a WordPress theme with all the functionality of a typical WordPress
 theme but almost none of the styling. The idea is that when starting a new
 theme, it is far easier to use this as a base then a theme that is already
 finished and styled.

Other than bringing it up to date, we've also:

 * Updated jQuery.
 * Fixed use of deprecated functions; it now works without warnings on 3.9.1
   with WP_DEBUG turned on.
 * Added a Meyer CSS reset.
 * Boilerplate blah in style.css to make theme-check happy.
 * Media queries, albeit blank ones, that work for us.
 * Uses HTML5 tags where appropriate.
 * A couple of default styles and default JavaScript that are common across
   all of our sites.

Feel free to use this for any purpose at all.
